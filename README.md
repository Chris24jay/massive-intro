# Massive

## Things to remember

* Massive looks for a folder called `db` in the root of our project. We cannot call this anything else. This has nothing to do with calling it `db` on app
* Inside of the `db` folder are regular sequel commands. Remember the spelling matters
* `.env` needs to be at the root of our project as well. This is where we store sensitve data. DO NOT PUSH UP YOUR .ENV file
